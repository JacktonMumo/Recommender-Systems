The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \"Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\\'s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, \"Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype.\" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress\\'s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \"significant\" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry\\'s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. \"A lot of the more established players were thinking, \\'It\\'s still an experiment,\\' \" he said. \"It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin\\'s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software\\'s development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin\\'s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. \"Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. \"Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\" Mr. Bonneau said. \"It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\"',\n",

       "       'February 9, 2017 - We begin each year with a look at the K-12 computer science landscape - whether the direct impact of Code.org and our partners, or the indirect and sometimes unrelated impact of other global efforts that share our vision. It\\'s been three and a half years since Code.org hired our first employee. We\\'ve been humbled to watch the world\\'s education system embrace computer science, at an ever-accelerating pace. During this short time, 11 countries, 31 U.S. states, and over 120 U.S. cities and school districts have announced efforts to expand access to computer science as part of the K-12 curriculum; the new Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course has launched in over 2,000 classrooms; over 50,000 U.S. teachers have attended workshops to begin teaching computer science; over 500,000 teachers globally have begun teaching computer science classes to over 16 million students; diversity in computer science classrooms has improved for two years in a row; the Hour of Code has surpassed 350 million served - reaching one out of every 10 students on the planet; and 8 Presidents and Prime Ministers have hosted events to inspire millions more to join this teacher-powered movement. To be clear, this isn\\'t the work of Code.org alone. We\\'ve had the support of hundreds of partners , and hundreds of thousands of educators, globally. Many of them began this work years before we existed. The international momentum is led by partners who share our mission in other countries. And in the U.S., this movement has had the bipartisan support of the federal government as well as most state governments. Our largest donors - Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Infosys, and Omidyar Network - deserve special recognition for funding not only Code.org but also the other nonprofits working towards the same goal, globally. We are thankful for all the efforts that share our mission. When we launched Code.org in 2013, it seemed impossible to change the entire education system. Although we still have a long way to go, 2016 was yet another record year, making us more confident than ever in our ability to realize our vision - that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Inspire students and increase diversity with the Hour of Code 20 million served 90M 48% female 195M 49% female 344M 49% female Enable students to show \"basic coding proficiency\" with CS Fundamentals. N/A N/A N/A 887,840 total 365,842 female Improve diversity in CS (measured among students on Code Studio) N/A 43% female, 37% African American or Hispanic 43% female, 37% African American or Hispanic 45% female, 48% underrepresented minorities , 47% free/reduced meal plans Lead a coalition to set policies supporting CS. Policies changed in: 5 states 16 states 17 states, including $9M in CS funding 31 states , including $13M in CS funding Addressing diversity in K-12 computer science is core to our mission. We all know the technology sector as a whole has a diversity problem , caused by a variety of factors. Our focus is on one piece of the problem, the education pipeline, where historically only 20~25% of students are female, and 13~15% are underrepresented minorities. By contrast, the students across Code.org classrooms are far more balanced across gender, race, and also socioeconomic status. This is partly because teachers integrate our courses into classrooms that are already diverse, and partly because we incorporate a focus on diversity throughout our work . For example, we published a study of 8,000 students who took a survey right before and after trying our tutorials. Among female high school students, the number who agreed with the statement \"I like computer science\" jumped from 55% to 75% from just one session of using Code.org\\'s Hour of Code activities. As another example, consider our Computer Science Principles course, designed for the new AP Computer Science exam. Traditionally, AP Computer Science is dominated by white and Asian males, with at most 15% underrepresented minorities. In our 512 classrooms, 49% of the students are underrepresented minorities - which adds up to more students than the entire nation\\'s AP computer science exam participation in 2016. (Side note: 53% of Code.org\\'s staff are women. Our board and leadership team are gender-balanced.) In the 3 years since we launched our Code Studio coding platform, 1/10 of all students on the planet have engaged in our computer science courses, making Code Studio the most broadly used curriculum in computer science. Of course, millions of these students are \"drive-by\" users. What matters more to us is how many teachers incorporate our lessons into their classrooms, and what their students learn. Example high school classroom project, using turtle-drawing commands Measuring by registered students, registered teachers, or monthly activity, Code Studio has doubled in scale in the last 12 months. But instead of measuring logins or page-views, in the last year, we embarked on creating a new metric of success. We began counting students who demonstrate \"basic coding proficiency\" in our CS Fundamentals course using a definition which we created based on student success at coding challenges. The chart below shows how many students demonstrated this proficiency at different levels of difficulty. (This is our first stab at measuring student proficiency, and we have a lot of work to improve it.) The secret behind our growth is simple: teachers recommend our courses to other teachers. One way to measure this is with the Net Promoter methodology : we score 85 among teachers, which is outstanding. This high score is supported by the testimonials we hear from teachers in classrooms. In the 2016-17 school year, we formally launched our App Lab app-making tool, and began scaling our new College Board endorsed Computer Science Principles course to prepare for a new AP exam. Computer science is already the fastest-growing AP course offered by the College Board, having almost doubled since Code.org launched. With this year\\'s new exam, 2017 is poised to be its biggest year yet. There are 2,600 schools participating in the new exam, according to the College Board audit. Among schools using College Board endorsed curricula, 55% are using Code.org\\'s CS Principles course. More than 75,000 students have interacted with our CS Principles course this school year. Our focus is the 512 classrooms of teachers in our professional learning program. These classrooms have 18,615 students enrolled, of which 5,721 are female students, and 9,083 are underrepresented minorities. If these students all take the exam, we have the opportunity to double the number of underrepresented minorities in AP computer science in just one year. In 2016 Code.org\\'s professional learning and school outreach programs accelerated in every dimension. We hosted 4 large professional learning conferences for educators, with stellar feedback. And we grew our network of regional partners and expert facilitators - this network will provide the backbone for the future growth of K-12 computer science. 52,000 computer science teachers prepared by Code.org Our professional learning network: over 40 regional partners, 400 expert facilitators And above all, across all our programs, we passed a new milestone: 52,000 computer science teachers have been prepared by Code.org. Most of these are elementary school teachers who will begin teaching 10-20 hours of computer science per year. But thousands of them are high school teachers teaching a year-long computer science class. More importantly, the feedback from our professional learning workshops is uniformly fantastic. The vast majority of teachers attending these workshops rank them the \"best professional development\" they\\'ve ever experienced. This is partly because America\\'s teachers want to learn and teach computer science, and partly because of the amazing passion of our expert facilitators. While most of Code.org\\'s staff and resources are focused on implementing computer science programs in schools, we have a small, crack team working on changing government policies to support, expand, and sustain K-12 computer science. This effort wouldn\\'t be possible without our coalition partners (especially Microsoft and the College Board), and our many local champions deserve the real credit for driving local change. Our state policy work focuses on 9 ideas we urge every state to consider . Below, we highlight our impact across 3 of these that are easiest to measure. Policy area Policy changed since 2013 High school graduation policy States that have changed policies to allow rigorous CS courses to satisfy core high school graduation requirements AL, AZ, AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IL, KY, LA, MD, MN, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, WA, WV, WI Establishing state-level standards for CS States that have developed or are in the process of developing state education standards for computer science AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IN, MA, NJ, SC, TX, VA, WA, WI, and WV. States that are evaluating developing standards: AL, DE, MD, MT, OK, and RI. Funding for CS States that have allocated funding specifically to K-12 computer science AR, AZ, GA, ID, MA, RI, UT, VA, WA. These states have allocated $13.01M in total Throughout 2016 we saw growing momentum for computer science among local governments beyond just the policy measures listed above. Chicago Public Schools became the first major school district to make computer science a graduation requirement for all students. The US Conference of Mayors proposed a resolution (sponsored by the mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Baltimore) to expand computer science in schools. Last but not least, we launched the Governors for CS partnership, bringing together the governors of Arkansas, Washington, Rhode Island, Iowa, Virginia, Idaho, and Nevada to build plans for K-12 computer science with more governors to join in 2017. After over a year of work by fourteen states and four school districts, dozens of writers and advisors, and leaders in corporate, nonprofit, and education sectors, the K-12 Computer Science Framework was launched in October with broad support . The framework offers a set of guidelines that could be used to inform the development of standards, curriculum, and computer science pathways, and also help school systems build capacity for teaching computer science. The impact of all the experts and organizations who came together to create the Framework will be felt for years to come. In December, we hosted 22 state teams to plan implementation work, and we will continue similar convenings to build on the momentum. In addition, in 2016, ETS announced it will create a new Praxis exam for credentialing teachers in computer science, and Pearson is working on a similar exam - both informed by the Framework. 2016 was the biggest year ever for the Hour of Code , which has now surpassed 350 million \"served.\" This year, Code.org handed important reins of the campaign to the education community: We gave a committee and review board the responsibility of setting the guidelines and rating the recommended activities . Hundreds of global nonprofits, corporations, and government agencies supported the campaign. From the new tutorials launched by Disney, Microsoft, and Google, to the activities and promotions hosted at Facebook offices and Apple stores, to the thousands of industry volunteers from other companies, the collaboration was amazing. Our own web site hummed along more smoothly than ever, thanks to the support of Amazon Web Services. The global campaign was launched by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . And the world\\'s greatest athletes supported this year\\'s Hour of Code with a special inspirational video for students. Presidents and prime ministers rally around the Hour of Code Eight presidents and prime ministers around the world have now hosted symbolic events to inspire students and educators to try computer science. The global Hour of Code campaign has established Computer Science Education Week as a fixture in hundreds of thousands of schools, each year recruiting tens of millions of new students and hundreds of thousands of teachers to try computer science. The work of our global partners has also helped build global momentum for computer science. In 2016, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Ireland, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia followed the lead set by UK, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Australia, and Italy to announce plans to integrate computer science into national curriculum. (See status of global CS efforts ) Last but certainly not least, the biggest headline in computer science in 2016 was the Obama administration\\'s announcement of Computer Science for All . The President announced that \"in the new economy, computer science isn\\'t an optional skill, it\\'s a basic skill.\" The announcement was coupled with a $4 billion proposal for Federal funding. Although the headline funding of CS for All didn\\'t pan out, the bully pulpit played an important role to accelerate this movement. The White House helped amplify and celebrate the work of the computer science community, and President Obama\\'s personal support for Code.org has been invaluable to the movement\\'s international growth. Local efforts such as CS4RI , CS4NH , CS4TX have sprung up in response and will serve as new rallying cries for the movement. Meanwhile, Congress unanimously authorized long-term NSF funding for computer science research which has provided foundational guidance and support to many efforts in the space. NSF funding has established new CS courses in hundreds of classrooms: 5~10% of all new CS teachers prepared this decade were funded by the NSF, and ~19% of all AP CS Principles teachers are teaching NSF-funded curricula. We\\'re thankful to the bipartisan leadership of the Representatives and Senators who supported continuing this work. Of course, together with the new CS Education Coalition , we will continue advocating for federal funding for computer science. Although most of the last few years\\' progress to expand computer science in U.S. schools have been funded by private donors and state governments, an injection of federal funding would greatly accelerate these efforts. Code.org recently penned a memo for the Trump administration laying out a very simple case: In 2016, Fortune 500 CEOs, 27 governors, and top education leaders joined forces to call for federal funding to address this. In 2017, thanks to the leadership of champions from both parties, we are as hopeful as ever that this goal is within reach. With yet another year of growth, we are more confident than ever in the strength and momentum behind the computer science movement, not just in the United States, but globally. Hundreds of thousands of worldwide educators have decided that every student in every school deserves the opportunity to learn computer science. The strength of this movement lies in the inspirational commitment of these teachers and educators. The nonprofits, philanthropists, and local governments who support them will continue and even accelerate our work in 2017 and beyond.

       "       'At JPMorgan Chase & Co., a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of lawyers\\' time annually. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges with fears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks. The push to automate mundane tasks and create new tools for bankers and clients -- a growing part of the firm\\'s $9.6 billion technology budget -- will be a theme as the company hosts its annual investor day on Tuesday. Behind the strategy, overseen by Chief Operating Operating Officer Matt Zames and Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy, is an undercurrent of anxiety: Though JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as one of few big winners, its dominance is at risk unless it aggressively pursues new technologies, according to interviews with a half-dozen bank executives. Redundant Software That was the message Zames had for Deasy when he joined the firm from BP Plc in late 2013. The New York-based bank\\'s internal systems, an amalgam from decades of mergers, had too many redundant software programs that didn\\'t work together seamlessly. \"Matt said, \\'Remember one thing above all else: We absolutely need to be the leaders in technology across financial services,\\'\" Deasy said last week in an interview. \"Everything we\\'ve done from that day forward stems from that meeting.\" A QuickTake explainer on fintech After visiting companies including and three years ago to understand how their developers worked, the bank set out to create its own computing cloud called Gaia that went online last year. Machine learning and big-data efforts now reside on the private platform, which effectively has limitless capacity to support their thirst for processing power. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money, Zames said. When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from , and . Tech Spending JPMorgan will make some of its cloud-backed technology available to institutional clients later this year, allowing firms like to access balances, research and trading tools. The move, which lets clients bypass salespeople and support staff for routine information, is similar to one announced in 2015. JPMorgan\\'s total technology budget for this year amounts to 9 percent of its projected revenue -- double the industry average, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. The dollar figure has inched higher as JPMorgan bolsters cyber defenses after a 2014 data breach, which exposed the information of 83 million customers. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg One-third of the budget is for new initiatives, a figure Zames wants to take to 40 percent in a few years. He expects savings from automation and retiring old technology will let him plow even more money into new innovations. Not all of those bets, which include several projects based on a distributed ledger, like blockchain, will pay off, which JPMorgan says is OK. One example executives are fond of mentioning: The firm built an electronic platform to help trade credit-default swaps that sits unused. \\'Can\\'t Wait\\' \"We\\'re willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn\\'t needed,\" Marianne Lake, the lender\\'s finance chief, told a conference audience in June. That\\'s \"because we can\\'t wait to know what the outcome, the endgame, really looks like, because the environment is moving so fast.\" As for COIN, the program has helped JPMorgan cut down on loan-servicing mistakes, most of which stemmed from human error in interpreting 12,000 new wholesale contracts per year, according to its designers. JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology, which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications. Another program called X-Connect, which went into use in January, examines e-mails to help employees find colleagues who have the closest relationships with potential prospects and can arrange introductions. Creating Bots For simpler tasks, the bank has created bots to perform functions like granting access to software systems and responding to IT requests, such as resetting an employee\\'s password, Zames said. Bots are expected to handle 1.7 million access requests this year, doing the work of 140 people. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While growing numbers of people in the industry worry such advancements might someday take their jobs, many Wall Street personnel are more focused on benefits. A survey of more than 3,200 financial professionals by recruiting firm Options Group last year found a majority expect new technology will improve their careers, for example by improving workplace performance. Click here for Options Group\\'s survey on technology\\'s impact \"Anything where you have back-office operations and humans kind of moving information from point A to point B that\\'s not automated is ripe for that,\" Deasy said. \"People always talk about this stuff as displacement. I talk about it as freeing people to work on higher-value things, which is why it\\'s such a terrific opportunity for the firm.\" To help spur internal disruption, the company keeps tabs on 2,000 technology ventures, using about 100 in pilot programs that will eventually join the firm\\'s growing ecosystem of partners. For instance, the bank\\'s machine-learning software was built with , a software firm that JPMorgan first encountered in 2009. \"We\\'re starting to see the real fruits of our labor,\" Zames said. \"This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.\"',\n",
